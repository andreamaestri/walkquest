# WalkQuest Project Rules

# Frontend Patterns
- Use Tailwind classes directly in HTML (no custom CSS or @apply)
- Follow Vue 3 Composition API patterns
- Use iconify-prerendered for all icons
- All components must integrate with Pinia stores for state

# Virtual List Implementation
- Use @tanstack/vue-virtual with computed options
- Base item height: 200px, expanded padding: 150px
- Always implement proper cleanup in onBeforeUnmount

# Map Integration
- Include Mapbox CSS in base.html
- Use empty container pattern for map
- Place controls outside map container

# Development Flow
- Format with both Prettier (frontend) and Ruff (backend)
- Always document store pattern changes
- All new features need corresponding tests
