# System Patterns: WalkQuest

## Architecture
WalkQuest follows a Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture on the backend with Django, and a component-based architecture on the frontend with Vue.js.

## Key Technical Decisions
- **Django for Backend:** Django was chosen for its robust ORM, security features, and ease of development.
- **Django Ninja for API:** Django Ninja was selected for building the API due to its performance and ease of use with Django.
- **Vue.js for Frontend:** Vue.js was chosen for its component-based architecture, reactivity, and ease of integration with Django.
- **PostgreSQL with PostGIS:** PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension was chosen for its spatial data capabilities.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS was chosen for rapid UI development and consistent styling.

## Design Patterns
- **API Gateway:** Django Ninja acts as an API gateway, routing requests to the appropriate backend services.
- **Component-Based UI:** The Vue.js frontend is built using reusable components, promoting modularity and maintainability.
- **Data Serialization:** Django serializers are used to convert database models into JSON format for the API.

## Component Relationships
- **WalkInterface.vue:** The main component that displays the walk list and map.
- **WalkList.vue:** A component that displays a list of walks.
- **MapView.vue:** A component that displays a map with walk routes.
- **api.js:** A service that handles communication with the backend API.
